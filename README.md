# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Being thoughtful helps me write quality code, but testing is always necessity, no matter my programming skill level. Simple, efficient, extensive testing helps verify program functionality and helps keep data secure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpet user needs by directly referring to their requests and requirements when writing code. I must translate their expectations into a clean, tested, documented, working program.

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, meeting user requirements is my primary goal. I must review and test my software to ensure that it is memory and time efficient, to ensure that it is safe and secure, and to ensure that it is readible and meets documentation requirements.
